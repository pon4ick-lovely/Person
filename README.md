## Features

The `Person` class includes the following features:

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the `Person` class:

```python
# Create Person objects
alice = Person("Alice", 30)
bob = Person("Bob", 25)

# Use methods
print(alice.introduce())
print(alice.greet(bob))

# Comparison
print(alice > bob)

# Arithmetic operations
combined = alice + bob
print(combined)

# Indexing
print(alice[0])  # Print first letter of Alice's name

# Iteration
for letter in alice:
    print(letter)
